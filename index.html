Woolworths — often referred to as “Woolies” — is a prominent South African retail company, officially known as Woolworths Holdings Limited, and is headquartered in Cape Town. Founded in 1931 by Max Sonnenberg, Woolies has grown into a diversified retail group offering food, fashion, homeware, beauty products, and financial services. 


The company operates on several fronts: its full-line stores combine food, clothing, and home goods; it runs standalone food stores (including smaller “Food Market” formats); and it also has cafés under the WCafé brand. 

 Woolworths also owns Absolute Pets, a pet-supply chain, which became part of its group more recently.

In terms of business strategy, Woolies places a strong emphasis on sustainability and customer experience. It has embedded its “Good Business Journey” into operations for years, and recently launched a long-term sustainability strategy that includes supporting small businesses and community development.
 On the retail front, Woolworths is heavily investing in its digital and omni-channel capabilities. Its on-demand delivery platform, Woolies Dash, has seen very strong growth, with same-day delivery and a dedicated “dark store” network to support online orders. 
 
Financially, the food division has been a major growth driver. In its recent trading results, the food business showed strong volume growth, and on-demand and online sales contributed significantly to its turnover.

In short, Woolies is not just a supermarket — it’s a premium, multi-category retailer that combines high-quality food, fashion, homeware, and financial services, while aggressively scaling its online presence and focusing on sustainability.
